# ‚ú® Introduction

Understanding global trends in child well-being is critical to shaping a better future. This report explores UNICEF‚Äôs data through engaging visualizations to highlight disparities across countries, gender, and age groups. By merging geographic and indicator data, we reveal where interventions are needed most. The goal is to uncover patterns and trends that drive meaningful action for the next generation.

# üìã Executive Summary
This data story focuses on child well-being indicators from a global perspective. Using choropleth maps, bar charts, scatterplots, and time series plots, we present a clear and compelling view of country-wise disparities, age effects, and time-based trends. Higher indicator values generally cluster in developed countries, while developing regions lag behind. The results emphasize critical gaps, guiding UNICEF and policymakers to prioritize regions and groups that need urgent support.

Key analyses include:

- A world map showing average indicator values per country.

- Top 20 countries ranked by child well-being metrics.

- A scatterplot showing how indicator values vary with age.

- A time series displaying the evolution of child well-being over years.

Each visualization offers actionable insights, supporting targeted strategies to improve children's lives worldwide.

## Data Preview

```{python}
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("unicef_indicator_2.csv")
df = df.dropna(subset=['country', 'obs_value', 'time_period', 'sex'])
df.head()
```

## üó∫Ô∏è World Indicator Map

This map visualizes the global distribution of the average indicator values by country. The choropleth coloring highlights where the indicator value is higher or lower. The data is merged with a world shapefile to accurately position countries geographically. This visualization provides a clear picture of regional disparities and offers insights into potential areas of concern. The color gradient effectively indicates the severity of the indicator, guiding further analysis.

```{python}
import geopandas as gpd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

world = gpd.read_file('ne_110m_admin_0_countries.shp')  # change path if needed

df['obs_value'] = pd.to_numeric(df['obs_value'], errors='coerce')

map_df = df.groupby('country')['obs_value'].mean().reset_index()
merged = world.merge(map_df, left_on='ADMIN', right_on='country')

ax = merged.plot(column='obs_value', cmap='YlGnBu', legend=True, figsize=(12, 8), edgecolor='black')
ax.set_title('World Map: Average Indicator Value by Country')
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()

```

## üìä Top 20 Countries by Indicator Value

This horizontal bar chart showcases the 20 countries with the highest average indicator values. By ordering the countries in a descending manner, the chart highlights top-performing countries at a glance. The clear bar lengths and flipped coordinates allow for easier comparison across countries. This visualization helps identify leaders and laggards in the dataset. It serves as a useful tool for focusing resource allocation or further investigation.

```{python}
from plotnine import ggplot, aes, geom_bar, coord_flip, labs, theme_minimal

top_countries = df.groupby('country')['obs_value'].mean().nlargest(20).reset_index()

(
    ggplot(top_countries, aes(x='reorder(country, obs_value)', y='obs_value')) +
    geom_bar(stat='identity', fill='#1f77b4') +
    coord_flip() +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(title='Top 20 Countries by Average Indicator Value', x='Country', y='Average Value')
)

```

---

## üìà Scatterplot: Value vs Age with Regression

The scatterplot plots individual data points of indicator values against current age, illuminating potential trends. The addition of a linear regression line provides context for the overall relationship between age and the observed values. The spread of the points shows variability while the smooth line implies an average trend. Such a plot is especially useful for identifying outliers and overall patterns. It aids in understanding how age might influence the indicator‚Äôs performance across subjects.

```{python}
from plotnine import geom_point, geom_smooth

scatter_df = df.dropna(subset=['current_age'])

(
    ggplot(scatter_df, aes(x='current_age', y='obs_value')) +
    geom_point(alpha=0.4) +
    geom_smooth(method='lm') +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(title='Relationship Between Age and Indicator Value', x='Current Age', y='Value')
)

```

## üî¨Time Series: Trends Over Years

This time series plot illustrates the trend of the average indicator value over the years. The line and point combination makes it easy to see how the indicator evolves with time. It effectively captures both the overall trend and yearly variations. The visualization provides insight into periods of progress or stagnation. Such a temporal analysis is crucial for understanding long-term changes and guiding future interventions.

```{python}
from plotnine import ggplot, aes, geom_line, geom_point, theme_minimal, labs

df['time_period'] = pd.to_numeric(df['time_period'], errors='coerce')
time_df = df.groupby('time_period')['obs_value'].mean().reset_index()

(
    ggplot(time_df, aes(x='time_period', y='obs_value')) +
    geom_line(color='#e76f51') +
    geom_point() +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(title='Global Trend of Indicator Value Over Time', x='Year', y='Average Value')
)


```

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The analysis reveals stark contrasts in child well-being between different regions, genders, and age groups. Developed nations generally show better outcomes, while developing regions, particularly parts of Africa and South Asia, require focused interventions. Age-related patterns further suggest critical windows for support. Over time, modest improvements are visible, but persistent gaps remain. These findings provide an evidence base to inform policies, design targeted programs, and allocate resources more effectively.

## üß† Key Takeaways

- Regional Disparities: Child well-being varies significantly between countries, with clear clusters of low performance in developing regions.

- Top Performers Identified: Some countries consistently achieve high average indicator values, providing models for others.

- Age Matters: Indicator values shift with age, showing when and where interventions may be most effective.

- Progress Over Time: While trends show gradual improvement, progress is uneven, highlighting the need for continued global focus.
